### Research Brief 
During congestion, when a vehicle enters an intersection with insufficient space to exit on the opposite side due to downstream traffic spillback, it often ends up obstructing movement of vehicle and predestrian on conflicting approaches with right of way. Impacts of such "blocking of box" instances can propagate to nearby intersections leading to capacity reductions and increased travel times on the routes and, in extreme cases, to gridlock. This research investigated the effectiveness of “Don’t Block the Box” (DBTB) treatments in minimizing driver’s blocking an intersection by: 1) conducting a “before-after” DBTB treatment comparison study at six intersections in Atlanta, Georgia and by 2) quantifying the impact of vehicle blocking behavior on intersection performance using a microscopic simulation model.
