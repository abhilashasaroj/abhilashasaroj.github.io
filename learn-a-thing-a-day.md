#### Azure Machine Learning service 
15 September 2020

**Resource Used**

Guided Projects by Coursera 
* [Predictive Modelling with Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://www.coursera.org/projects/predictive-modelling-azure-machine-learning-studio)
* [Machine Learning Pipelines with Azure ML Studio](https://www.coursera.org/projects/azure-machine-learning-studio-pipeline)

Gained familiarity with using Azure Machine Learning Studio to develop predictive ML based model, evaluate it's performance and to deploy the trained predictive model as web service. The interface is quite intuitive to use, specially after getting introduced to it in the course. However, it will take practice to know the many different modules it has. The interface has several modules that perform task such as "clean missing data", "split data", "evaluate model", and "two-class boosted decision tree model" etc. You pick the already built modules from the list of modules, drag them to the dashboard step by step, link them to create a flowchart kind of figure in the dashboard and run them as you go. There is an ease in going back and forth either to change the modules used or to try different parameters/attributes in these modules. In the guided projects, free tiral account option is used to access the interface resource. The data can be visualized easily at any of the steps in the flowchart and at the end model evaluation metric such as AUC (Area Under The Curve) and ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) among several others etc are obtained. This excercise gave me a quick recap of the important steps in the data pre-processing part when developing a ML model and introduced to the Azure ML studio tool.
