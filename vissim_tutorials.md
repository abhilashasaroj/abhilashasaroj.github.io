### VISSIM Tutorials - Active Project (under construction)
Role: Self-initiated

#### Project Brief
I plan to develop small size tutorials to learn using PTV's VISSIM traffic simulation software. More specifically, the tutorials will focus on using VISSIM's COM feature to apply dynamic changes in simulation runs. In graduate school, it was hard for me to learn to use COM feature and play with simulation models as beginner programmer and VISSIM software user. I hope these small size tutorials give you a good headstart in modelling dynamic control in VISSIM.
